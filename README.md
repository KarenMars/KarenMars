Welcome to my Github page! 

I'm KarenMars and I am a software engineer in NXP. Before I joined NXP, I worked as an algorithm engineer in the field of NLP in iFlytek, a Chinese company who provides AI services. I obtained my Embedded Systems Master's degree from Delft University of Technology.

I am interested in utilizing artificial intelligence techniques for real-life problems, for example, automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.
